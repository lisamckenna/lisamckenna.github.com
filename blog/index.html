<!--what if i make a change to header (like changing the alt), 
	I'd have to change it manually on all pages now. Is there a way to have it be global change?-->
	
<!--	this is a great point. it's also one of the reasons that PHP, despite being a hideous and bodged-together language,
	is so hugely popular. with PHP, it's simply a matter of using what are called "includes". 
	
	you split up your files into templates like header.inc, footer.inc (the .inc filename is just to remind you 
	that they're not standalone pages; you could also show this by naming them _header.php, _footer.php, or whatever you like).
	You just put them in an "includes" folder on your server. Then, on each page, you just write:
	
	<?php
	include "includes/header.inc";
	?>
	
	that will retrieve your .inc file, evaluate it, and inject it into that space. You could also do this with JavaScript,
	but it's usually better to do it on the server side if you can (for many reasons, including SEO and accessibility).
	
	now for the downer: you need to serve the files off a PHP-enabled web server for this to work. 
	almost all basic web servers have PHP installed, but this means no opening local pages directly in the browser;
	you have to download a utility like MAMP (http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) to develop locally.
	
	happy to go over all this on Thursday if we have a moment before/after class!

		<h2>THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.</h2>
		<p>DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex! Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz. Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox. Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack. Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Sex-charged fop blew my junk TV quiz. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex. Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Quick, Baz, get my woven flax jodhpurs! <em>"Now fax quiz Jack!"</em> my brave ghost pled. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed. Flummoxed by job, kvetching W. zaps Iraq. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk. <a href="#top"><i>(back to top)</i></a></p><hr />

		<h2>JOLT MY WAX BED.</h2>
		<p>Few quips galvanized the mock jury box. Quick brown dogs jump over the lazy fox. The jay, pig, fox, zebra, and my wolves quack! Blowzy red vixens fight for a quick jump. Joaquin Phoenix was gazed by MTV for luck. A wizard's job is to vex chumps quickly in fog. Watch "<a href="http://www.jeopardy.com/">Jeopardy!</a>", Alex Trebek's fun TV quiz game. Woven silk pyjamas exchanged for blue quartz. Brawny gods just flocked up to quiz and vex him. Adjusting quiver and bow, Zompyc<sup>[1]</sup> killed the fox. My faxed joke won a pager in the cable TV quiz show. Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes. My girl wove <strong>six dozen</strong> plaid jackets before she quit. Six big devils from Japan quickly forgot how to waltz. <a href="#top"><i>(back to top)</i></a></p><hr />

Crazy Fredericka bought <em>many</em> very exquisite opal jewels.Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag. A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats.
