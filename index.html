        <h3>Hello World!</h3>
        <p>My name is Lisa McKenna, it's a wonder I have a name since I was nameless for weeks after I was born. Mom wanted Jennifer. Dad didn't, as a jenny is a donkey in Ireland and his girl wouldn't be named after a donkey (or worse). He wanted his girl named Lisa Marie, like Elvis. And he obviously won.</p>
        <h3>My Journey so Far.</h3>
        <p>I had plans to be a painting major at MassArt, but switched it around when I fell in love with typography. I hand cut letterforms 'til my fingertips bled, and manipulated fonts like crazy. What I loved about MassArt was its focus on the business of design, which is rare. It helped lessen the blow when, perusing a cosmetics counter at Macy's, I discovered a comp I designed as a lowly-intern was mass produced for an entire Estee Lauder fragrance line. Best lesson for a green designer. Undeterred, I co-founded <a href="http://www.limadesign.com">a graphic design studio</a> where I've chartered tons of innovative projects with awesome clients for 20 years. In 2010 I founded <a href="http://www.curiousmarie.com">a second company</a> which will be focused on UX design and development for iOS, web and e-Bookery. I'm really excited about the RampUp, its community and being able to fuse my design skills with understanding code. I'm tired of turning down web jobs. I love that I've discovered how intuitive html is and I look forward to using a font other than Times Roman soon.</p>
        <h3>What Else?</h3>
        <p>I have two hilarious kids. I'm a first gen American obtaining dual citizenship. I love the sound of bowling alleys. My husband will vouch I cook a mean ribeye. I have an affinity for <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tuGhKyaKBI8/R8o1fWFwqeI/AAAAAAAAAUo/PsYcAoSXZZU/s400/hans1.jpg">Scandinavian design.</a> I'm inspired daily by the <a href="http://dnok91peocsw3.cloudfront.net/inspiration/8710-612x612-2.png">Holstee Manifesto</a>. I've owned way too many Mac products in my life, but have always wished for an <a href="http://bit.ly/15NLGxz">Apple Lisa</a>, probably not if my name was Jenny. Thanks for reading!</p>
